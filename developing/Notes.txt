--- ToDo ---

verbose - report timing for each test and suite
Check errors in AddTest is caught by our testing

--- Maybe ---

refactor tests to not explicitly depend on assertException?
Add clearing of suite to BeginSuite so commenting out a test removes it without deleting it explicitly? Or a function ClearSuite to do it explicitly?
errors - catching unexpected exceptions (and messages)
Logging?
redesign public interface, RunTest called something else?
Test coverage analysis
go through UnitTest to get ideas (catch errors from tests? time/memoryConstrained)


--- Bugs ---

bug? counting teardown in number of tests run?

bug? something to do with earlier definition of function more permissive and not cleared?
testIsCorrectExtraVectors - Failed AssertEquals[False, isCorrectExtraVectors$36936[{{1, 2}}]], gave HoldComplete[AssertEquals[False, isCorrectExtraVectors$36936[{{1, 2}}]]]
