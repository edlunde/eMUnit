--- ToDo ---

proper error message when wrong option given to RunTest[__, ReportMethod -> opt]

Check errors in AddTest is caught by our testing

matchQN - should {0, tol} match {x_, x_}?

--- Maybe ---

Add clearing of suite to BeginSuite so commenting out a test removes it without deleting it explicitly. If one wants to add more tests to a suite after EndSuite one should do it explicitly with AddTest[suite,...]

should passOnMessages append to $MessageList instead?

errors - catching unexpected exceptions (and messages)?
Logging?
redesign public interface, RunTest called something else?
Test coverage analysis?
go through UnitTest to get ideas (catch errors from tests? time/memoryConstrained)


--- Bugs ---

bug? something to do with earlier definition of function more permissive and not cleared?
testIsCorrectExtraVectors - Failed AssertEquals[False, isCorrectExtraVectors$36936[{{1, 2}}]], gave HoldComplete[AssertEquals[False, isCorrectExtraVectors$36936[{{1, 2}}]]]
