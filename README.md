Framework for testing Mathematica code in the xUnit tradition, written before the addition of the built-in testing framework with Mathematica 10.0.
Initially developed as an exercise in Test-Driven Development, now only maintained to support old projects.

Everything needed to use the package is contained in the eMUnit.m file.
